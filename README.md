### What is Gold and Silver in War Robots?

Before we dive into the best ways to get free Gold and Silver, let‚Äôs quickly define what these resources are and why they matter.

- **Gold**: This is the premium currency in War Robots. Gold allows you to speed up upgrades, purchase premium robots, and unlock valuable items that help you progress faster. While it‚Äôs not as common as Silver, it is highly sought after for its ability to enhance your gaming experience.

- **Silver**: The standard in-game currency, Silver is used to purchase most robots, weapons, and modules. Unlike Gold, Silver is easier to earn but is still crucial for overall progression.

Now that we understand the importance of these resources, let‚Äôs move on to the best methods to collect them without spending any real money.

### 1. **Complete Daily and Special Tasks**

One of the most reliable ways to earn free Gold and Silver in War Robots is by completing the daily and special tasks offered within the game. These tasks are designed to reward you with various resources for simply playing and completing specific objectives, such as:

- Winning a certain number of battles
- Destroying a specific number of enemy robots
- Playing a set number of matches

Make it a habit to check the task list every day. While completing these tasks may take some time, they are a great way to steadily accumulate both Gold and Silver.

### 2. **Participate in Events**

War Robots frequently holds in-game events that offer great rewards, including free Gold and Silver. These events may be tied to special themes, seasons, or holidays, and they often feature limited-time tasks or challenges. Participating in these events can significantly boost your in-game currency.

To maximize your rewards during events, make sure to:

- Log in daily to collect any event bonuses
- Complete the event challenges as quickly as possible
- Keep an eye on any exclusive event rewards that grant Gold or Silver

If you‚Äôre active during events, you‚Äôll quickly build up your resources and unlock exclusive items!

### 3. **Watch Ads for Free Gold and Silver**

Many mobile games, including War Robots, offer players the option to watch advertisements in exchange for in-game rewards. This is a simple and easy way to earn free Gold and Silver without investing too much time. Simply go to the ‚ÄúFree Offers‚Äù or ‚ÄúWatch Ads‚Äù section of the game, and you‚Äôll often find various ads that grant you rewards after watching them.

Though the rewards might not always be large, they add up over time, so it‚Äôs worth taking advantage of this feature whenever you can.

### 4. **Join a Clan**

Joining a clan is one of the best ways to boost your earnings in War Robots. Not only does being part of a clan offer social and strategic benefits, but it also comes with great rewards. Many clans have regular tournaments, clan missions, and events that give free Gold and Silver.

As a member of an active clan, you‚Äôll often be rewarded for your participation, whether it‚Äôs through clan chest rewards or completing collective goals. So, look for a clan that‚Äôs actively involved in the game and consistently participates in clan-based activities.

### 5. **Use Third-Party Rewards Programs**

Another great way to get free Gold and Silver in War Robots is by using third-party reward platforms. Websites and apps like Google Play Rewards or Tapjoy offer players the chance to complete surveys or offers in exchange for free credits. Once you accumulate enough credits, you can exchange them for Gold or Silver in War Robots.

Be mindful of the offers that you choose, and ensure that they are legitimate to avoid any risks to your account.
